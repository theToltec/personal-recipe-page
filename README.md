My first Project!
This is a very basic recipe website. This will help me practice basic HTML skills. Thank you Myspace for giving me a head start on this.

Perhaps I can end up actually using this site on my local network to store recipes? I'm excited to be doing all this. Maybe I'll look back on this while sitting in my house in Hawaii? If so, great job man. You did it. Don't forget to enjoy yourself and remember you can do anything you set your mind to. Stay motivated!
